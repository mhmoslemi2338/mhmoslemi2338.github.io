<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


<!-- I’m a Responsible AI researcher with roots in Electrical Engineering and a deep interest in data-centric, trustworthy AI (fairness, robustness, and etc).
My recent work addrese fairness in data integration and cleaning.  I combine optimal transport, causality, and optimization to design practical algorithms that bridge theory and deployment.  Results have appeared at SIGMOD'24, IEEE BigData'24, and GUIDE-AI @ SIGMOD'24; a follow-up is under review at IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering.


### Academic path  
- **M.Sc. Computer Science, Western University**  
  *Supervisor – Dr. Mostafa Milani*  
  - Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant  
  - Additional RA work with **Dr. Samira Hasanzadeh** (Economics Dept. & Huron College)  

- **B.Sc. Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology**  
  *Senior Project – Graph-based Biomedical Imaging*  
  *Co-supervisors – Dr. Arash Amini & Dr. Hossein Sameti*  

### What I bring  
A systematic, engineering mindset shaped by EE fundamentals, paired with rigorous ML training and publication-driven research.  I thrive at the intersection of **fair ML, optimization, and applied machine learning**, always aiming to translate solid math into deployable, equitable AI systems.

### Looking ahead  
I’m actively seeking **R&D or research roles**—industry or academic collaborations—where responsible AI, algorithmic fairness, and optimization meet real-world data challenges.  Feel free to reach out if your team is working toward equitable, trustworthy AI. -->

I’m a responsible-AI researcher with a background in electrical engineering, focused on developing data-driven methods for trustworthy AI. My interests include fairness, robustness, and explainability in ML systems. I approach research with an engineering mindset shaped by my undergraduate training at Sharif University, where I worked on biomedical imaging and automatic speech recognition under the supervision of [Dr. Arash Amini](https://sharif.ir/~aamini/) and [Dr. Hossein Sameti](https://sharif.edu/~sameti/).


More recently, my research has focused on fairness in data integration and data cleaning. I use techniques from optimal transport, causality, and optimization to design methods that improve both performance and equity in data systems. My work has been published at top venues including SIGMOD and IEEE BigData. I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Western University, supervised by [Dr. Mostafa Milani](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmilani7/). I also held research roles in the Economics Department and at Huron College with [Dr. Samira Hasanzadeh](https://www.samirahasanzadeh.com/).


I'm currently seeking research and development roles in responsible AI, fairness in ML, and applied ML. I’m also open to research collaborations across academia and industry. -->
